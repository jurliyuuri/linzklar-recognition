# linzklar-recognition

## What this is 
Linzklar is a logographic writing system used mainly in [Faikleone](https://wikirlevip.miraheze.org/wiki/Faikleone), a [conworld](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Conworld) the authors of this repository are building. This repository currently contains the data set of hand-written linzklar (written by the builders of the conworld through a [Web app](https://github.com/jurliyuuri/linzi-recognition)), with which we aim to implement a handwriting linzklar input system in the future.
