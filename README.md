# linzklar-recognition

## What this is 
Linzklar (pronounced LINTS-claah), or Lanermic logogram, is a logographic writing system used mainly in [Faikleone](https://wikirlevip.miraheze.org/wiki/Faikleone), a [conworld](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Conworld) the authors of this repository are building.

This repository currently contains the dataset of hand-written linzklar (written by the builders of the conworld through a [Web app](https://github.com/jurliyuuri/linzi-recognition)), with which we aim to implement a handwriting linzklar input system in the future.

## Data format

[/data](https://github.com/jurliyuuri/linzklar-recognition/tree/master/data) contains all the raw data, where each JSON file is either an array of `{ "character": (annotation), "data" : (array of array of {x: number, y: number}) }`, or `{ "character": (annotation), "data" : (array of array of {x: number, y: number}), initialDotCaptured: true}`. Each array of coordinates corresponds to a stroke; an array of strokes makes up a character. Due to an oversight, for the first 30,126 samples the initial dot of every single stroke is absent from the data, and such files are marked with the lack of `initialDotCaptured: true`.

Since Linzklar is (obviously) not in Unicode, and since the use of Private Use Area in a public place like a GitHub repository is to be frowned upon, each annotation is actually given in terms of a conventionally determined mapping to a Chinese character. Hence <img src="https://jurliyuuri.github.io/lin-marn/%E7%87%90%E5%AD%97%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F/%E7%8E%8B.png" width="30" height="30" /> is annotated as `王`, <img src="https://jurliyuuri.github.io/lin-marn/%E7%87%90%E5%AD%97%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F/%E5%86%A0.png" width="30" height="30" /> as `冠`, and so on.

[/data_images/svg](https://github.com/jurliyuuri/linzklar-recognition/tree/master/data_images/svg) contains all the raw data converted into svg images. `initial_dot_captured` contains the >20,000 samples whose initial dot of every stroke is properly recorded. `initial_dot_omitted` is made up of >50,000 samples stripped off of their initial dots (unintentionally for the first 30,126; intentionally for the remaining data). `initial_dot_captured_or_augmented` is a folder containing all the images in `initial_dot_captured`, as well as the first 30,126 samples with each of the missing initial dot inferred (by a simple linear interpolation) from the remaining dots.

Inside each `/data_images/svg/initial_dot_*` are folders whose names are the annotations (given in terms of the Chinese characters), and each folder contains the svgs (supposedly) corresponding to the same character.

`/data_images/svg` is generated by converting from `/data` using `/converter`. Provided that you have [cargo installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), all you need to do is

```
$ cd converter
$ cargo run --release
```

[/data_images/png](https://github.com/jurliyuuri/linzklar-recognition/tree/master/data_images/png) is the same as `/data_images/svg`, except that it is converted to png with [mogrify](https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php).
